# GameSociety
This is a Social Media for Gamers, made usign .jsp, .html, .css and .java files. 
This Social Media is using RESTFul API Services to trasnfer information from clients to the server (Apache Tomcat). 
The database used was MySQL

# In this repository you will find
Inside the folder named Karamolegkos_Panagiotis_E17065:
- my_db: A sample database.
- my_files: A whole dynamic web project with all the files needed to run the Social Media.
- my_documentation: A documentation made as a Technical Manual and User Manual in the Greek language.

# To run the Social Media

Start the MySQL Server
Start TomCat Server
After Starting your Servers you will have to access the path below and run the .jsp file: 
```
Game Society/Web Content/Pages/welcome/login.jsp
```
If you have not put the MySQL Database given in the my_db file to your MySQL Server, then the APIs will make a Database ready for use while loging in.

You are ready to go :)
